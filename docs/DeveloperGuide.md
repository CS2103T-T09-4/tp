## 3. Design

This section details the various components of the application. It covers the internal structure of each component and
how the components work together with one another.

### 3.1 Component Overview

The components of the application are Main, Commons, UI, Logic, Model and Storage.

<p align="center"><<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />
<p align="center">Figure 1.Overview of components and their relationships </p>

The **_Component Overview Diagram_** above shows the high-level design of the application.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for:

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

<p align="center"> Figure 2. Example of a component's API and functionality

#### How the architecture components interact with one another

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `remove 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
<p align="center"> Figure 3. Components interacting with one another

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 Common classes

Common classes are classes used by multiple components. Common classes include:

- `Index`: Represents a zero or one based index. Using `Index` removes the need for a component to know what base other
  components are using for their index. Can be converted to an integer (int).
- `Messages`: Stores messages to be displayed to the user.
- `GuiSettings`: Contains the GUI settings.
- `LogsCenter`: Writes messages to the console and a log file. Records the state of the program as the app is running.

### 3.3 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

<p align="center"> Figure 4. UI component class relationship diagram </p>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component,

- Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts (`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`)
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

`MainWindow.fxml` - Houses the rest of the fxml (commandBox,HelpWindow, etc) in the VBox. Contains the code for the actual menu bar

`CommandBox.fxml` - Stackpane where the user writes input

`DeckListPanel.fxml` - Houses a ListView<Deck>

`DeckListCard.fxml` - (not housed by Mainwindow.fxml) contains the data from each deck

`EntryListPanel.fxml` - Houses a ListView<Entry>

`EntryListCard.fxml`- (not housed by Mainwindow.fxml) contains the data from each entry

`HelpWindow.fxml` - Only displays label and copy url button

`ResultDisplay.fxml` - Prints results to user

`StatusBarFooter` - returns the path of the file retrieved

### 3.4 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

<p align="center"> Figure 5. Logic component class relationship diagram

1. `Logic` uses the `WorkBankParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is passed to `LogicManager`.
   1. The `Command` is first checked by `PhaseManager` whether it can be executed in the current `Phase`.
   1. If yes, execute the `Command`; otherwise, throw `PhaseIncorrectException`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a deck).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<p align="center"> Figure 6. Interactions between different parts of the logic component

### 3.5 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

<p align="center"> Figure 7. Model component class relationship diagram

Figure 7 shows a general overview of the model component. The diagram below will give more details about the
word bank section of the model component.

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelWordBankDiagram.png)

<p align="center"> Figure 8. Structure of classes in the word bank

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
- stores a `FilteredList<Deck>` object that maintain`s the current list of decks in memory.
- exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Deck>`  and `ObservableList<Entry>`
that can be 'observed'. E.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- does not depend on any of the other three components.

### 3.6 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

<p align="center"> Figure 9. Storage component class relationship diagram

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

- can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
- can save the word bank data, such as `Deck`, `Entry`, `Word` and `Translation` in json format and read it back.
- can save the statistics and scores of each individual quiz
``
Each `Word` and `Translation` is saved in a `JsonAdaptedWord `and `JsonAdaptedTranslation` object respectively.
Each `Entry` is saved in a `JsonAdaptedEntry` object, consisting of a `JsonAdaptedWord` and `JsonAdaptedTranslation`.
Each `Deck` is saved in a `JsonAdaptedDeck` object, consisting of a list of `JsonAdaptedEntry`.

This format allows the files to be saved in json format and be read back accurately.

### 3.7 PhaseManager component

![Structure of PhaseManager Component]()

<p align="center"> Figure 10. PhaseManager component diagram (WIP)

**API** : [`PhaseManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/phase/PhaseManager.java)

The `PhaseManager` component serves the following functions:

- Keep track of the current `Phase` (`LOBBY`, `QUIZ`, `RESULTS`) the app is in.
- Validate whether a `Command` can be executed in the current `Phase`.
- Check whether a `Command` is a `PhaseTransitionCommand` and if so, update the `Phase` to be the `nextPhase` specified by this `PhaseTransitionCommand`.

---

## 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how and why certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Deck System (Melanie)

This feature allows the user to create multiple lists of entries rather than having
all entries together in the same list. The user could have different decks
for different languages or multiple decks for the same language.

E.g.

- Deck 1: Japanese
- Deck 2: Spanish Food
- Deck 3: Spanish Animals

#### Design Considerations

The rationale behind the deck system is so that users will be better able to organize their entries.
A deck system will also allow the flashcard system, a proposed feature, to be implemented more easily.

### 4.2 Select Deck (Melanie)

This feature requires the user to select a deck (using `select <index>`) in order to change the contents of the deck.
Once a deck is selected, entry level operations such as `add`, `delete`, `find`, `list` can be performed.

The implementation of this feature requires the GUI to be updated whenever a deck is selected. This is done by using the
UI, Logic and Model components. The selected deck is retrieved from `FilteredList<Deck>` in the model component and replaces
the current entries in the `UniqueEntryList` object of WordBank causing the UI to change accordingly. A similar
approach is done for other commands that changes the UI such as `new <deck>` and `clear` command

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: Command format to select a deck

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `select <deck_index>` Select a deck before any entry level command can be given.
  E.g. `select 1` followed by `delete 1`
  - Pros: Easier for a user to make continuous changes to the same deck
  - Cons: Users have to give an additional command
- **Alternative 2**: `delete <deck_index> <entry_index>` Entry level commands specify a deck. E.g `delete 1 1`
  - Pros: Single command for users to execute
  - Cons: May cause confusion to the users.

### 4.3 Flashcard System (Gabriel)

Three additional commands are used for the flashcard system -  PlayCommand, StopCommand and AnswerCommand.

By default, StopCommand and AnswerCommand cannot be accessed by the user until a PlayCommand is typed by the user.

![Sequence Diagram of Play Command](images/PlayCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 11. Sequence Diagram of Play Command

With reference to Figure 11, after a PlayCommand is created:
* A boolean isPlayMode in AddressBookParser becomes True (not shown yet as the implementation might change).
* All following user inputs are treated as either an AnswerCommand or a StopCommand
* A Leitner object is created that stores the current entries of the selected deck and shuffles them
* The Leitner object also forms questions and answers list based on the shuffled list

![Sequence Diagram of Answer Command](images/AnswerCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 12. Sequence Diagram of Play Command

With reference to figure 12, when the user types a AnswerCommand into the system:
 * The AddressBookParser first checks if it is current is in play mode via the boolean isPlayMode
 * If it is not in play mode, an error message is shown to the user via the UI
 * If it is in play mode, an AnswerCommand containing hte user input is sent to the model and checked against
  the current question in Leitner.java
 * The response (correct / wrong answer) is then relayed backed to the user and the next question is loaded.
 * The process ends when the Leitner.java has no more question to ask (not shown as implementation might change)

__The diagram for this process will be created after the flashcard system is implemented__

#### Design Considerations:

##### Aspect: Type of flashcard system

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)** : Leitner System
  - Pros: The Letiner system is a proven quizzing system that increases the user's rate of learning by
          using spaced repetition. Flashcards are sorted based on the user's ability to answer them. Correctly
          answered flashcards are put at the end of the question queue and incorrectly answered
          flashcards are placed at the front.
          (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)
  - Cons: More difficult to implement
- **Alternative 2** : Random shuffling system
  - Pros: Easier to implement
  - Cons: Users may not learn as effectively

### 4.4 \[Proposed\] Data Analysis

Some of the proposed parameters tracked by GreenTea include:

- Number of correctly answered flashcards
- Previous scores
- Average time taken in total
- Time of quiz

From these data, GreenTea would be able to derive some meaningful analytics to
display to the user. These include:

- Progression since last attempt
- Length of time between quizzes
- Most forgotten phrase/translation
- Language mastery
- Progress in each deck

_{Feature will be added in v1.3.2}_
